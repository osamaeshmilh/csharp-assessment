SHU Term 1 MSc c sharp assessment

Assessment Brief
-	This is group work. This is individually assessed.
-	You must organise as a group of 2 (3 is too many).
-	One representative of the group must email module leader (m.j.rezai@shu.ac.uk ). 
o	Email must eb copied to the 2nd member of the group.
o	Email must contact full names and student numbers.
o	Deadline for the email is 11/11/2022. Following this date students without group will be grouped randomly.

Introduction
This assignment provides you with the opportunity to consolidate your skills,  design, and implement the above concepts in a working program.
int class is a much used and well documented .NET class. The operations that are performed on objects of this class are often arithmetic. The object of this exercise is to implement a new class, the Binary class. This class will do operations on binary representations of integers. 
In the course of the module, you will learn to ..
-	Build C# console application using .NET Framework. 
-	Implement your own Binary class:
o	You will implement not only to mimic the behaviour of int class, but also to extend operations to include some that are specific to Binary representation. 
o	You will extend the behaviour of Binary to extend operations to include some that are specific to Binary representation of integers.
o	You must work with 16 bits binary representations of integers. Your must implement the following operations:
	Binary operators: Ones’ complement (~), twos’ complement or negator (-), Shift to the left (<<), Shift to the right (>>)
	Binary arithmetic operators and Logical operators: +, -, *, /, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= 
o	All algorithms must perform in binary. Algorithms that convert to denary, perform in denary, and convert back to binary carry 0 marks.  
-	Construct code: use types, create variables, design methods and code constructs, and design class.

Tasks and Submission:
o	You are provided with a Console solution (Binary.zip). Download the solution and implement ‘Binary.cs’ class to pass tests in ‘Program.cs’.
o	‘Binary.cs’: This class requires your implementation. Regions have been defined in the class to help you with the requirements. In implementing this class, you are encouraged to consider good practice for code design. Good consideration needs to be given to method design, sensible use of types and variables, and good code construct. Good and sensible OO practice is encouraged. 
o	‘Program.cs’: This file contains tests that your implementation must pass with expected outcomes. You are not to make changes to ‘Program.cs’. Note that ‘Program.cs’ is not intended to be rigorously testing all possible sensible practices. These tests must be used as helpful guidance and you are expected to apply results of your own investigations and enquiries, over and above these tests.
o	‘ExpectedOutcome.txt’: This is the expected output of application of tests and execution of your implementation. Use this as reference.
o	Submit, only, the class file ‘Binary.cs’ to the submission point on BB. One member submits on behalf of the group.
